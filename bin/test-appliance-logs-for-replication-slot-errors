# Parses the Leader and Follower log files created by the `dump-appliance-logs`
# script for error patterns related to replication slots issues. Error patterns
# that are matched are prefixed with the line number of where the match
# occurred, and are tabbed in for (hopefully) better readability.
#
# NOTE: Leader and Follower logs are tested for different patterns/cases.
